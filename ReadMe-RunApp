A small notice for running the app :

1 - Open the app and wait the welcome message to finish
2 - Speak any phrase contaning the word "Weather"
3 - Then the app will say the current weather in Berlin

In case of any error that occurs on the weather server, the app will say an error message.

The app needs an internet connection to be able to recognise the phrases, and to get the weather ofcourse !
